# STUDENT-DBMS
MADE BY ARNAV ATREY and RITVIK RAJESH
This project makes evaluation of student performance in subject examinations across classes easier with the help of database and matplotlib library. 
Student's data entered will be stored in the database and will be used to make individual report cards and class wise analysis with the ability to slice and dice across different metrics.
